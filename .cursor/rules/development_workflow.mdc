# Development Workflow

## Getting Started

1. **Setup the Database**
   ```bash
   # Create the database
   rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

2. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   # Start the Rails server and Vite dev server
   bin/dev
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open http://localhost:5100 in your browser


## Frontend Development

### Frontend Assets Location
- JavaScript: `app/frontend/entrypoints`
- CSS: `app/frontend/stylesheets`
- Images: `app/frontend/assets`

### Using Vite with Rails
- All frontend assets are managed by Vite
- Vite development server runs alongside Rails server
- Use the `vite_javascript_tag` and `vite_stylesheet_tag` helpers in views

Example:
```erb
<%= vite_javascript_tag 'application' %>
<%= vite_stylesheet_tag 'application' %>
```

### Stimulus Controllers
- Located in `app/frontend/controllers`
- Register controllers in `app/frontend/controllers/index.js`

## Database Conventions

### Creating New Migrations
```bash
# Create a new migration
rails g migration CreateNewTable
```


Deployment is managed with Kamal:
```bash
kamal setup
kamal deploy
```
