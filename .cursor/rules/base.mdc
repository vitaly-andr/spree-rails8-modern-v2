change_management:
  process:
    - "Always check current file state before proposing any changes"
    - "First explain what is wrong and why it needs to be changed"
    - "Propose a clear solution with alternatives if applicable"
    - "Wait for explicit user confirmation before making any changes"
    - "Make changes one file at a time to allow proper review and error tracking"
    - "Never modify code or configurations unrelated to the agreed changes"
    - "Document the changes after they are approved and implemented"
    - "After user accepts changes (clicks Accept All), proceed with next steps without additional confirmation"
  
  file_state_check:
    - "Use appropriate tools to read current file content"
    - "Verify the actual state matches assumptions"
    - "Check if proposed changes are really needed"
    - "Avoid redundant modifications"
    - "Prevent accidental overwrites of existing content"
  
  best_practices:
    - "Always check official documentation before implementing solutions"
    - "Never make changes without user confirmation"
    - "Present all possible solutions with pros and cons"
    - "Explain potential impact of changes"
    - "Provide rollback steps if needed"
    - "Keep track of all changes for documentation"
    - "After user accepts changes, consider it as approval to continue with related tasks"
