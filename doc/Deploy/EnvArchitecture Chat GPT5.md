# Rails Environment Architecture Problem

## Problem Statement

I have a Rails 8 application with Spree Commerce that uses multiple SQLite databases (main, Solid Queue, Solid Cache, Solid Cable) and I'm experiencing deployment issues with Kamal due to environment configuration conflicts.

## Current Architecture

### Dockerfile Configuration
```dockerfile
ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
    BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
    BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
    BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
```

### Kamal deploy.yml Configuration
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: staging
    DATABASE_URL: sqlite3:/rails/storage/databases/staging.sqlite3
```

### Database Configuration (database.yml)
```yaml
production:
  primary:
    database: storage/databases/production.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_production.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_production.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_production.sqlite3

staging:
  primary:
    database: storage/databases/staging.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_staging.sqlite3
```

### Docker Entrypoint
```bash
if [ "${@: -2:1}" == "./bin/rails" ] && [ "${@: -1:1}" == "server" ]; then
  echo "üöÄ Preparing databases..."
  ./bin/rails db:prepare
  
  echo "üíæ Setting up Solid Cache database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cache
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cache
  
  echo "‚ö° Setting up Solid Queue database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_queue
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_queue
  
  echo "üì° Setting up Solid Cable database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cable
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cable
  
  echo "‚úÖ All databases ready!"
fi
```

## The Conflict

1. **Build Time**: Docker builds with `RAILS_ENV=production`, creating databases with `production` suffix
2. **Runtime**: Kamal runs container with `RAILS_ENV=staging`, expecting databases with `staging` suffix
3. **Result**: Application can't find the databases it needs

## Deployment Error Symptoms

- Container starts successfully (databases setup completes)
- Health checks fail because Rails server doesn't start properly
- Error: `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3000`
- Rails server command issues with Thruster integration

## Questions for AI

1. Should I remove `RAILS_ENV="production"` from Dockerfile and let Kamal set it at runtime?
2. Or should I keep production environment for build but handle database paths differently?
3. How should `DATABASE_URL` override work with multiple databases (Solid Queue/Cache/Cable)?
4. Is the docker-entrypoint condition correct for Thruster command: `["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]`?
5. What's the best practice for Rails 8 + Solid gems + Kamal deployment architecture?

## Additional Context

- Using Rails 8.0.2 with Spree Commerce
- Thruster for HTTP acceleration
- Multiple SQLite databases for different components
- ARM64 deployment to Hetzner server
- Kamal 2.x for deployment

## Expected Outcome

A clean deployment where:
- Docker build process works correctly
- Runtime environment is properly configured
- All databases are created and accessible
- Health checks pass
- Application starts successfully on the specified port
```

## Answer ‚Äî CI/CD Best Practices (2025)

### Executive summary
- Build a single, environment-agnostic image. Select the environment at runtime (12-factor).
- Do not set global `RAILS_ENV` in the Dockerfile. Let Kamal provide `RAILS_ENV` per environment.
- Do not use a global `DATABASE_URL` when you have multiple databases. Prefer per-db URLs via `database.yml` or keep the file paths there.
- Make database preparation idempotent and independent of the exact start command (works with or without Thruster).
- Persist SQLite files on a mounted volume and ensure Kamal maps it on each host.
- Run web and Solid Queue worker as separate Kamal roles/accessories.
- Add supply-chain and build improvements (SBOM, provenance, caching) in CI.

---

### 1) Should `RAILS_ENV="production"` be removed from Dockerfile?
**Yes.** Best practice is an environment-agnostic image:
- Remove `ENV RAILS_ENV="production"` from Dockerfile.
- Keep bundler slim with `BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development:test"`.
- Only set `RAILS_ENV` at runtime via Kamal per environment (e.g., `staging`, `production`).
- If any build-time step truly needs production context (e.g., asset build), set it inline for that step only, not globally.

Minimal example in Dockerfile (build stage excerpt):
```dockerfile
# Instead of globally setting RAILS_ENV in the image:
# ENV RAILS_ENV="production"

# If you must run a production-only build step, do it inline:
# RUN RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

Why: avoids the ‚Äúbuilt as production, run as staging‚Äù drift and eliminates the suffix mismatch risk for SQLite paths.

---

### 2) Keep production at build but handle DB paths differently?
**Not recommended.** The clean solution is to:
- Avoid creating or referencing any environment-specific DBs during image build.
- Defer all DB creation/migration to runtime.
- Let `database.yml` control paths per environment and keep a single image.

This makes the image portable across `staging` and `production` without rebuilding.

---

### 3) How should `DATABASE_URL` override work with multiple databases?
**Do not set a global `DATABASE_URL`** if you‚Äôre running multiple databases. It overrides the primary and often causes confusion. Prefer either:
- Keep explicit file paths in `database.yml` (no `DATABASE_URL` at all), or
- Use per-db env vars with `url:` keys for clarity.

Example `database.yml` pattern:
```yaml
production:
  primary:
    url: <%= ENV["PRIMARY_DATABASE_URL"] %> # optional; if absent, fallback to file path
    database: storage/databases/production.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    url: <%= ENV["SOLID_QUEUE_DATABASE_URL"] %>
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_production.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    url: <%= ENV["SOLID_CACHE_DATABASE_URL"] %>
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_production.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    url: <%= ENV["SOLID_CABLE_DATABASE_URL"] %>
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_production.sqlite3
```

For SQLite you‚Äôll usually skip the `url:` and rely on file paths. The key point: **do not** set a single global `DATABASE_URL` in Kamal when you have multiple DBs.

---

### 4) Is the docker-entrypoint condition correct for Thruster?
Current entrypoint runs DB prep only when args are exactly `["./bin/rails", "server"]`. With Thruster (e.g., `["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]`), this condition won‚Äôt match and DB prep won‚Äôt run.

Two robust options (pick one):
- Always run `db:prepare` on container boot (idempotent), gated by an opt-out flag.
- Or, detect both patterns (`rails server` alone or wrapped by `thrust`).

Example (robust and simple):
```bash
# Always prepare on boot; allow opt-out with SKIP_DB_PREPARE=1
if [ -z "${SKIP_DB_PREPARE}" ]; then
  echo "üöÄ Preparing databases..."
  ./bin/rails db:prepare

  echo "üíæ Solid Cache..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cache
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cache

  echo "‚ö° Solid Queue..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_queue
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_queue

  echo "üì° Solid Cable..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cable
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cable

  echo "‚úÖ All databases ready!"
fi
exec "$@"
```

Or, if you prefer conditional:
```bash
if [[ "$*" == *"./bin/rails server"* ]]; then
  # ... same db prep block ...
fi
exec "$@"
```

Either way, it will work with both `./bin/rails server` and `./bin/thrust ./bin/rails server`.

### 5) Best-practice architecture (Rails 8 + Solid gems + Kamal, 2025)

- **Image**
  - Single, env-agnostic image.
  - Non-root user (`USER 1000:1000`) ‚Äî already good.
  - Persist `/rails/storage/databases` on a volume for SQLite durability.
  - Healthcheck `/up` ‚Äî already good.
  - Consider adding SBOM/provenance in CI (SLSA/Syft/CycloneDX) and image signing (Cosign).

- **Runtime (Kamal)**
  - Set `RAILS_ENV` per environment in Kamal `deploy.yml`.
  - Do not set a global `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Mount the storage volume:
    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - "/var/lib/spree/storage:/rails/storage"
    ```
  - Provide secrets (e.g., `RAILS_MASTER_KEY`) via Kamal secrets.
  - Configure roles: web and worker.

- **Processes**
  - Web: Thruster (optional) + Rails server.
  - Worker: Solid Queue runner as a separate accessory/container.
  - Action Cable: Usually served within the web process for SQLite-backed Solid Cable; scale if needed later.

Example Kamal `deploy.yml` excerpts:
```yaml
# env per stage
env:
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: staging
    RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: "1"
    RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: "1"
  secret:
    - RAILS_MASTER_KEY

volumes:
  - "/var/lib/spree/storage:/rails/storage"

# web app
servers:
  web:
    hosts:
      - 10.0.0.10
    cmd: ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
    healthcheck:
      path: /up
      port: 3000

# worker accessory for Solid Queue
accessories:
  solid_queue:
    service: "solid-queue"
    hosts:
      - 10.0.0.10
    cmd: ["./bin/rails", "solid_queue:start"]
    env:
      clear:
        RAILS_ENV: staging
    volumes:
      - "/var/lib/spree/storage:/rails/storage"
```

- **Migrations**
  - Keep DB prep in entrypoint as shown (idempotent).
  - Optionally, run `kamal app exec -- bundle exec rails db:migrate` in a pre-deploy hook if you prefer explicit migration steps. With SQLite, ensure the volume is attached before that step.

- **Assets (Vite)**
  - Ensure assets are built in CI or image build:
    - If using `vite_ruby`, `assets:precompile` will run `vite build`. Add a build step:
      ```dockerfile
      # In build stage, after COPY:
      RUN RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
      ```
    - Do not start a dev Vite server in production.

- **Supply chain & CI (2025)**
  - Use BuildKit/buildx with cache mounts for faster builds.
  - Generate SBOM (e.g., Syft) and sign images (Cosign).
  - Scan images (Trivy/Grype) in CI before deploy.
  - Record provenance (SLSA level where possible).
  - Keep `apt` layer minimal and pinned; remove caches (already done).

---

### Concrete changes to apply

- Dockerfile
  - Remove `ENV RAILS_ENV="production"`.
  - Optionally add `RUN RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile` in the build stage (if assets are required for prod).
- Kamal
  - Remove global `DATABASE_URL` from `deploy.yml`.
  - Keep `RAILS_ENV` under `env.clear` per environment.
  - Add a host volume for `/rails/storage`.
  - Add a Solid Queue accessory.
- Entrypoint
  - Run `db:prepare` block either always (idempotent) or with a relaxed condition that matches Thruster-wrapped server.

### Example end-state snippets

Dockerfile (highlights):
```dockerfile
# no global RAILS_ENV here
ENV BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
    BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
    BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development:test"

# After copying code in build stage:
RUN RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

database.yml (SQLite paths; no global DATABASE_URL needed):
```yaml
staging:
  primary:
    database: storage/databases/staging.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_staging.sqlite3
```

docker-entrypoint (always prepare; safe):
```bash
#!/bin/bash -e
# jemalloc setup (as-is) ...

if [ -z "${SKIP_DB_PREPARE}" ]; then
  echo "üöÄ Preparing databases..."
  ./bin/rails db:prepare
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cache && ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cache
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_queue && ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_queue
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cable && ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cable
  echo "‚úÖ All databases ready!"
fi

exec "$@"
```

Kamal `deploy.yml` (staging excerpt):
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: staging
    RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT: "1"
    RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES: "1"
  # no DATABASE_URL here

volumes:
  - "/var/lib/spree/storage:/rails/storage"

servers:
  web:
    cmd: ["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]
    healthcheck:
      path: /up
      port: 3000

accessories:
  solid_queue:
    cmd: ["./bin/rails", "solid_queue:start"]
    volumes:
      - "/var/lib/spree/storage:/rails/storage"
```

### Final checklist
- One image for all envs; env selected at runtime.
- No global `DATABASE_URL`; use `database.yml` per-db configs.
- Persistent volume for `/rails/storage` mapped in Kamal.
- Entry-point db prep robust to Thruster.
- Solid Queue runs as a separate Kamal accessory.
- Assets built during image build (or CI) for production.
- CI adds SBOM, scanning, and signing before deploy.
