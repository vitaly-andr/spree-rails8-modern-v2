# Rails Environment Architecture Problem

## Problem Statement

I have a Rails 8 application with Spree Commerce that uses multiple SQLite databases (main, Solid Queue, Solid Cache, Solid Cable) and I'm experiencing deployment issues with Kamal due to environment configuration conflicts.

## Current Architecture

### Dockerfile Configuration
```dockerfile
ENV RAILS_ENV="production" \
    BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT="1" \
    BUNDLE_PATH="/usr/local/bundle" \
    BUNDLE_WITHOUT="development"
```

### Kamal deploy.yml Configuration
```yaml
env:
  clear:
    RAILS_ENV: staging
    DATABASE_URL: sqlite3:/rails/storage/databases/staging.sqlite3
```

### Database Configuration (database.yml)
```yaml
production:
  primary:
    database: storage/databases/production.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_production.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_production.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_production.sqlite3

staging:
  primary:
    database: storage/databases/staging.sqlite3
  solid_queue:
    database: storage/databases/solid_queue_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cache:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cache_staging.sqlite3
  solid_cable:
    database: storage/databases/solid_cable_staging.sqlite3
```

### Docker Entrypoint
```bash
if [ "${@: -2:1}" == "./bin/rails" ] && [ "${@: -1:1}" == "server" ]; then
  echo "ðŸš€ Preparing databases..."
  ./bin/rails db:prepare
  
  echo "ðŸ’¾ Setting up Solid Cache database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cache
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cache
  
  echo "âš¡ Setting up Solid Queue database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_queue
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_queue
  
  echo "ðŸ“¡ Setting up Solid Cable database..."
  ./bin/rails db:create:solid_cable
  ./bin/rails db:migrate:solid_cable
  
  echo "âœ… All databases ready!"
fi
```

## The Conflict

1. **Build Time**: Docker builds with `RAILS_ENV=production`, creating databases with `production` suffix
2. **Runtime**: Kamal runs container with `RAILS_ENV=staging`, expecting databases with `staging` suffix
3. **Result**: Application can't find the databases it needs

## Deployment Error Symptoms

- Container starts successfully (databases setup completes)
- Health checks fail because Rails server doesn't start properly
- Error: `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 3000`
- Rails server command issues with Thruster integration

## Questions for AI

1. Should I remove `RAILS_ENV="production"` from Dockerfile and let Kamal set it at runtime?
2. Or should I keep production environment for build but handle database paths differently?
3. How should `DATABASE_URL` override work with multiple databases (Solid Queue/Cache/Cable)?
4. Is the docker-entrypoint condition correct for Thruster command: `["./bin/thrust", "./bin/rails", "server"]`?
5. What's the best practice for Rails 8 + Solid gems + Kamal deployment architecture?

## Additional Context

- Using Rails 8.0.2 with Spree Commerce
- Thruster for HTTP acceleration
- Multiple SQLite databases for different components
- ARM64 deployment to Hetzner server
- Kamal 2.x for deployment

## Expected Outcome

A clean deployment where:
- Docker build process works correctly
- Runtime environment is properly configured
- All databases are created and accessible
- Health checks pass
- Application starts successfully on the specified port
```
